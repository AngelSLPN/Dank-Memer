# Dank Memer

A discord bot made primarily with node.js and discord.js, with plans to constantly add commands and grow to new platforms.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you started using the bot and making sure it is set up well on your server. If you are having issues with the bot, be sure to check over these steps again.

### Prerequisites

To add the bot to your server, you need to meet at least one of the following requirements:

* Be the owner of the server
* Have "Manage Server" permission on the server

For the bot to work properly, it will need all of the permissions seen in the below image.

You can [click here](https://goo.gl/ktrEbN) for an invite that has these permissions pre-selected for you.

### Using the bot

The prefix to use the bot is `pls` *Example: pls ping*. No, not `!`, `?`, or `-` like most bots. Prefixes don't have to be a common symbol!

To get the full command list, you can do `pls help`.

All commands use the same prefix, and are updated constantly!
